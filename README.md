# Investigate-a-Dataset
# Project Overview
I will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

## What do I need to install?
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv

## Introduction 
 I will conduct data analysis and create a file to share the documents I findings. I should start by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions, and create a report sharing the answers.
